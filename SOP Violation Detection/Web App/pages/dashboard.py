The application is developed using famous detection tools and technologies Python, YOLO, OpenCV, and Streamlit. The developers have trained the model using a personalized dataset that was collected from various regions of Pakistan. The application shows efficient results in less favorable environments i.e., processes low-resolution CCTV footage of different public places. ")
